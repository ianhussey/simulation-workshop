# Simulated data & Monte-Carlo simulation studies

## Overview

This repo contains materials for the 2-day workshop "Simulated data & Monte-Carlo simulation studies" first taught at the Unviersity of Bern in Fall 2024.

The course assumes users are familar with R, R Markdown, dplyr, and tidyr, as well as graduate level statistical methods. It was designed for a PhD students and postdocs.

It teaches a tidyverse approach to Monte-Carlo simulation studies using {purrr}.

All simulations are implemented in R using a specific workflow written in [{tidyverse}](https://www.tidyverse.org/) and [{purrr}](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) that is designed to maximise ease of writing, interpreting, and reusing code - sometimes at the expense of the speed at which the code runs at. 
Researchers who are already familiar with writing simulations whose simulations may be more computationally intensive should consider implementing them in other dedicated packages such as [{SimDesign}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SimDesign/vignettes/SimDesign-intro.html) or [{simhelpers}](https://meghapsimatrix.github.io/simhelpers/).
